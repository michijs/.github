Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lucas! And this is my main project. I have been working on it for more than two years. 

## FAQ

> What is your project about?

MichiJS is an open source project that helps developers create custom elements. While there are multiple libraries doing this job, many use cases are not covered by most of them and I decided to cover them myself.

> Why should I sponsor you?

Creating and maintaining quality open source projects can take a significant amount of time. While it is time that I enjoy, monetary support goes a long way in making me feel appreciated when I use my free time to do this work. I would also like to grow this project, since it is important to me.

> Why Michi?

Michi is a colloquial way of calling cats. I am a huge fan of this animal and have owned many of them throughout my life.
